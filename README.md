What Home means to me.

This assignment follows the theme of "What does home mean to me" by means of showing how my childhood was. As an introvert with a game-oriented father, I have always been a fan of consoles as well as PCs. To me, home is my actual home, the computer that I use everyday, and the games I can play with my friends and alone.
